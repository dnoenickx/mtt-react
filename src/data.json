And with almost 25% of the Bikeway abutting conservation land along at least one side, the Bikeway brings you close to a variety of wooded uplands, cedar swamps, and ponds. Wildlife abounds along the Bikeway, from the microscopic plankton in the sea to quahogs, bluefish, River Herring, eels, egrets, Great Blue Herons, Red-tailed Hawks, Osprey, turtles, Red Fox, muskrats,

The Weeks Bridge opened in 1927 to carry pedestrian traffic between the Harvard Business School's newly built Allston campus and Harvard's main campus in Cambridge. It is named for John W. Weeks, a longtime U.S. Representative and later U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, and the U.S. Secretary of War in the Harding and Coolidge administrations.\nOn September 21, 2015, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation held a ribbon cutting to mark completion of a $3 million renovation that made the Weeks bridge handicap accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Stairs at either end were replaced with ramps and accessibility-compliant railings were installed on the bridge. Other improvements included new accessible approach paths, new lighting using replicated historic fixtures, restoring the eroded river bank adjacent to the bridge, and repairs to the bridge masonry and structure.","state":"paved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-71.1188214,42.3678449],[-71.1174523,42.3691402]]]},"trails":[99],"events":[],"links":[]},{"id":606,"name":"Boston Harborwalk-Bike Friendly Segment","description":"Boston and MassDOT maps recognize this sidewalk-like section of the Harbor Walk as a shared used path where bikes are allowed.

It was named to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Boston Pops Orchestra public performances on the Charles River Esplanade. Conductor Arthur Fiedler, who led the Pops from 1930 to 1979, spearheaded the campaign to bring music to the Esplanade. He conducted the first public concert at the site of the Hatch Shell in 1929 and continued to lead the Pops in regular public performances at that site until he retired.","state":"paved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-71.0727405,42.355393],[-71.07288,42.3557141],[-71.0729927,42.3559123],[-71.0730839,42.3558964],[-71.0729551,42.3557141],[-71.0729015,42.3557141],[-71.0731482,42.3560035],[-71.0733413,42.3561026],[-71.0736525,42.3561739],[-71.0740548,42.3561581],[-71.0740602,42.3561145],[-71.0737651,42.3561343],[-71.0737705,42.3561977],[-71.0741567,42.356162]]]},"trails":[99],"events":[716,780],"links":[]},{"id":627,"name":"Richard McKinnon Park and Shared Use Paths","description":"Richard McKinnon Park is an 8.5-acre park located along the left bank of the Charles River on the border of Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts, created as mitigation for the taking of planned parkland for the construction of the Big Dig.\nThe shared use path passes the Lynch Family Skate Park.\nPart of the Mass Central Rail Trail.","state":"paved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-71.0674497,42.3696166],[-71.0676697,42.3696324],[-71.0679271,42.3696166],[-71.0686835,42.3701596],[-71.0687855,42.3701199],[-71.0689893,42.370223],[-71.0697081,42.3699574],[-71.0716179,42.3709245],[-71.071929,42.3709126]]]},"trails":[63],"events":[727],"links":[]},{"id":628,"name":"Hooper Farm Path","description":"This 0.6 mile-long path goes from the Sparks Avenue rotary to the Surfside Drive split.","state":"paved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-70.090927,41.2710898],[-70.0909217,41.2708841],[-70.0934666,41.2686978],[-70.0969019,41.263776],[-70.0975309,41.2627697],[-70.0978292,41.2621757],[-70.0980953,41.2614543],[-70.0982486,41.2611937],[-70.0985227,41.260636]]]},"trails":[180],"events":[],"links":[{"text":"Hooper Farm Path","url":"https://www.nantucket-ma.gov/2546/Hooper-Farm-Path"}]},{"id":629,"name":"First Way Path","description":"","state":"paved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-70.0981092,41.2713641],[-70.097503,41.2711383],[-70.0972723,41.2710254],[-70.0969719,41.2708077],[-70.0967198,41.2705859],[-70.0960653,41.2697594],[-70.0950139,41.2694126],[-70.0932544,41.2688723]]]},"trails":[180],"events":[],"links":[]},{"id":630,"name":"Silber Way Overpass","description":"","state":"paved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-71.1003645,42.3507597],[-71.1003538,42.3508232],[-71.100681,42.350843],[-71.1006461,42.3510709],[-71.100453,42.3510591],[-71.1004477,42.3510947],[-71.1008366,42.3511165],[-71.1008366,42.3511998]]]},"trails":[99],"events":[],"links":[]},{"id":631,"name":"","description":"This section in Piper Farm is owned by the Town of Belchertown.","state":"unimproved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-72.4074937,42.2741971],[-72.4064047,42.2720536]]]},"trails":[113,63],"events":[79],"links":[]},{"id":632,"name":"","description":"","state":"unimproved","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-72.3417811,42.2183134],[-72.3424893,42.2193503]]]},"trails":[113,63],"events":[79],"links":[{"text":"Mountain Biking - Canal Trails","url":"https://www.trailforks.com/region/canal-trails-31856/"}]},{"id":633,"name":"Blackstone River Bikeway Section 7","description":"The project extends from Quinsigamond Avenue along Lamartine St., Hermon St., and Francis J.

The resident filed a lawsuit in Barnstable Superior Court in 1970, seeking to overturn the taking.","links":[{"text":"The Shining Sea Bikeway - A Triumph of Citizen Action","url":"https://www.woodsholemuseum.org/oldpages/sprtsl/v16n1-Bikeway.pdf"}]},{"id":135,"headline":"Additional builds of the Shining Sea Bikeway","date":"1998-01-01","date_precision":"y","description":"After freight service on the Falmouth-North Falmouth section ceased, incremental builds of the Shining Sea Bikeway occurred from Locust Street to Depot Avenue, to Skating Lane, and then to Carlson Lane in downtown Falmouth.","links":[{"text":"The Shining Sea Bikeway A History","url":"https://oncapemagazine.com/the-shining-sea-bikeway-a-history/"}]},{"id":136,"headline":"CSX Derailment South of Route 20 in Sudbury","date":"2000-01-01","date_precision":"y","description":"Active freight use of the formerly CSX-owned railway from South Sudbury to Framingham ends in 2000, following the derailment of a train in Sudbury, south of Route 20.

The small existing park at the station could be expanded over the entire train platform, with the community path traversing the park between Lexington Street and Trapelo Road.\nA route along the south side of the Fitchburg Line from Waverley to the Belmont Housing Authority (BHA) parking lot, leading to a new pedestrian/bicycle bridge crossing from behind the BHA building at 59 Pearson Road to the north side of the Fitchburg Line just west of the Clark Street Bridge\nA route along the north side of the Fitchburg Line through Belmont Center and along the tracks behind Channing Road until Alexander Avenue, then crossing under the tracks to the south side, and crossing back to the north at Brighton Street\nMeanwhile, the Fitchburg Line Improvement Project, a five-year, $306-million-dollar, federally funded project to improve service along the entire 53 mile line, involved extensive construction in Belmont. New track was laid from Belmont Center to Brighton Street, along with two new north-south track cross-overs, a new signaling system, three new signal houses on the south side of the tracks (abutting the high school property) and four new signal towers. The MBTA altered the location of one signal house to accommodate a possible future underpass at Alexander Avenue Extension based on input from the Belmont selectmen.

The answer is no, and in 2019 the selectmen vote to route the path along the north side of the Fitchburg Line from Alexander Avenue to Brighton Street. (The MBTA also expressed “dire concerns” about a path crossing the Fitchburg Line at Brighton Street in a November 2018 letter to the selectmen.)\nIn November 2018, Town Meeting appropriates $400,000 of Community Preservation Act funds for design of the Phase 1A (Phase 1) of the Belmont path in order to synchronize path design with the design of the new middle-high school.
